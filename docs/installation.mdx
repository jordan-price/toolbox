# Installation

You can install the Toolbox package via Composer:

```bash
composer require jordan-price/toolbox
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Laravel 8.0 or higher (for Laravel integration)

## Configuration

After installation, publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JordanPrice\Toolbox\ToolboxServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `config/toolbox.php` file in your application.
